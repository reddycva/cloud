# Join worker node to the cluster
echo "Joining worker node to the Kubernetes cluster..."

# Wait for the master node to be ready and generate the join command
# You'll need to get the join command from the master.
# For simplicity, we'll assume a way to get it from the master.
# In a real automated setup, you'd transfer it or use a shared folder.

# For this example, we'll manually get the join command *after* vagrant up finishes
# and then ssh into each worker and run it.
# A more advanced Vagrantfile would use a shared folder or another mechanism
# to pass this token automatically.

# Placeholder for actual join command (to be run manually or automated later)
# The actual command will be printed by 'kubeadm init' on the master node.
# It will look something like:
# sudo kubeadm join 192.168.56.10:6443 --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash>
